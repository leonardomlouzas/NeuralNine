# Learning _Flask_ through NeuralNine

Repository made to organize my learning about Flask from NeuralNine.

## Organization

Every lesson will be separated by a branch.

In each branch, commits will be in chronological ordered based on how the code changes through the lesson.

The README.md of each branch will contain useful information about the lesson.

## Getting started

Simply head to the [**branches**](https://github.com/leonardomlouzas/NeuralNine/branches) page of this repository and click on the branch you want to check.
